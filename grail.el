;; Grail is an attempt to seek the Holy Grail of Emacs Theory:
;; unification of all the various essential bits of elisp in a sane
;; deployment.
;;
;; Grail on a more basic level is a grand load-path hack for the Elisp
;; coder who can't leave anything alone.
;;
;; This file serves as the entry-point for a Emacs configuration. You
;; should link .emacs to this file at the root of the directory
;; grail-elisp-root.

(defconst grail-release-version "0.0.2"
  "the release number of grail.el")

(defvar grail-elisp-root
  (or (getenv "USER_ELISP") (concat (getenv "HOME") "/emacsmoduler/"))
  "The root of the user's elisp tree")

;; This code will assume a FS structure like this:
;;
;; $HOME/.emacs.d/            | all of emacs scribbles here by default so I treat
;;                              it like /var
;;
;;  user-elisp-root           | all of my emacs customization and elisp. I keep
;;                              it outside of .emacs.d and under version control
;;                              so that emacs session state does not mix with
;;                              source which is very different in lifetime and
;;                              content management.

;; all of the following paths are relative to user-elisp-root. Files that
;; do not exist are silently ignored.

;; grail.el                   | entry point for emacs startup and phase #1
;;                              of the configuration.
;;
;; grail-fn.el                | library of functions essential to phase #1
;;
;; elisp.el                   | user elisp functions, should not be (interactive) only:
;;                            | loaded by --script

;; user.el                    | user customization of Emacs.

;; commands.el                | user commands only loaded in interactive Emacs
;; keys.el                    | user key-binding customization
;; interface.el               | modify the mainline Emacs interface, gui agnostic.
;; gui.el                     | only loaded with a window-system

;; linux.el                   | only loaded on gnu/linux.
;; darwin.el                  | only loaded on darwin.
;;
;; local/(*)                  | elisp maintained by the user.
;;      emacs/                | local elisp that modifies or replaces packages/files distributed
;;                              with the mainline.
;;      elisp/                | elisp maintained by the user that complements the mainline.
;;
;;      patches/              | patches against distributed emacs files required
;;                              by my config.
;;      styles/               | modules that combine loading/deploying required packages
;;                              with configuration that blends those packages into a
;;                              harmonious "style" of using Emacs.

;; dist/(*)
;;     elisp/                 | elisp maintained and distributed by a Third Party.
;;                              Usually this is for projects you contribute to where
;;                              you want to keep a VCS checkout.
;;     elpa/                  | elisp maintained by ELPA.

;; The files user-elisp-root are not in the load-path and must be loaded with explicit paths.
