Truetype versions of the X-Symbol fonts
=======================================

(1) isaxsym.ttf

As a substitute for the xsym1 font, here is a hotch-potch, "better
than nothing" True Type Font isaxsym.ttf. that does not support super-
and subscripts. Please treat it as a temporary stand-in until better
solutions are available.

(2) XSymb1Medium.ttf and XSymb0Medium.ttf emulate the X-Symbol font
layout, using glyphs from free TeX fonts, which are scalable and
hinted.  Note that XSymb0Medium is merely a variant of the Adobe
Symbol font, so XSymb1Medium.ttf is usually sufficient.
