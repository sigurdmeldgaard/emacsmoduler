 generic/   Generic basis for Proof General


A small number of example proofs are included in each prover 
subdirectory.   The "root2" example proofs of the irrationality
of the square root of 2 were proofs written as a response
to a challenge of Freek Wiedijk in his comparison of different
theorem provers, see http://www.cs.kun.nl/~freek/comparison/.
Those proof scripts are copyright by their named authors.
(NB: some of these may have rusted)
