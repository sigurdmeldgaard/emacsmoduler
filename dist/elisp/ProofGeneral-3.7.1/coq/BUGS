* Coq Proof General Bugs

See also ../BUGS for generic bugs.

** Multiple file handling and auto-compilation is incomplete

** C-c C-a C-i on long intro lines breaks line the wrong way.

** coqtags doesn't find all declarations. 

It cannot handle lists e.g., with "Parameter x,y:nat" it only tags x
but not y. [The same problem exists for legotags] Workaround: don't
rely too much on the etags mechanism.
  
** Others not mentioned...
